## üë®‚Äçüíª What it does
- SocioMark is essentially a social media platform that lets users create an account to upload and share images. Every image upload is added to the user's profile and can be shared with other users. 
- After uploading the image, the user's unique hash created from their profile is encoded within the image. Users can `verify` an image's `copyright` and see if it matches with the user who uploaded the image. If the verification fails, users can flag an image to take down, protecting the original creator's copyright.

## üì± Progressive WebApp
SocioMark is now a Progressive WebApp for better accessibility and user experience. It allows users to install the app directly from the web to their desktops/home screens and provides the native app-like experience. SocioMark is fully responsive, compatible and provides users with the same experience across tablets, mobile devices, and desktops

## ü§î Challenges
- One of the main challenges we ran into with this project is incorporating the numerous functions required of a social media platform.
- From login and registering authentication to implementing like and comment functionality for posts and even building user profiles, there are many parts to creating a viable social media app, and it took a lot of work to implement everything.
- Additionally, building the encoder required a lot of research and trial and error. Finally, integrating the frontend and the backend of the platform and debugging the full functionality proved to be a challenge as well.
